# File_alert-management-system-and-text-extraction

i am trying to build an application such that when a user tries to upload any file into s3 bucket we should get a notification in turn with details of that file name and timestamp and other important details.

once i finish the above then i will try to intigrate textract such that when ever user uploads he will get notification and also extracted text.

and i will plan to integrate the mongoDB with this project after completing the above two requirements and will store the user name and file name in mongoDB.

after that i will plan to integrate some more additional functionalities such that user can retrieve all the files which are under his name.

Then i will plan to store the extracted text also into the mongoDB such that when ever user want to get he simply should give his name and uploaded filename.
